I think your analysis is great and you are off to a great start. You have a lot of great data that will allow you to run very interesting analysis and visualizations

If you would like to provide the data file, I am happy to run the code on my machine to confirm I don't experience any bugs. 

I have two broad observations: 
	1) I think you have a great opportunity to generate broad, team-level insights based on a season worth of data. 
	2) I also think you have a great opportunity to dive deeper into sections of the data to identify very compelling insights. 

I think a defensive coordinator for a football team would be able to make the most use of your data by addressing the following questions:
	a) At various points in the game (e.g. 2 minutes left in the 4th quarter; when the opposing team is losing by >=7 points; etc), what types of plays does a given team call? How predictable are these play calls by each team? 

	b) What plays by the opposing team result in scores? turnovers? defensive stops? yardage? 

	c) When its 3rd down and 2 yards to go, what plays does a team call? When its 3rd down and 12 yards to go, what plays does a team call? 


Given the numerous ways that you can slice and dice the data, being able to visualize the data will be particularly helpful to allow a user to digest the data.
