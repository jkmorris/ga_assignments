I think your analysis is great and you are off to a great start. You have a lot of great data that will allow you to run very interesting analysis and visualizations

If you would like to provide the data file, I am happy to run the code on my machine to confirm I don't experience any bugs. 

In terms of futher analysis, you may want to group by street and then categorize by contributing factor, date and time. 
	What trends are found? 
	Can accidents, by street location, be predicted? If so, can accidents be prevented? 

By creating a "micro" or "street-level" analysis of car accidents to identify accident trends (e.g. intoxicated drivers tend to cause accidents on Flatbush Avenue on Friday and Saturday between 10pm and 4am), you will have a compelling set of findings that you can provide to NYC police to help them consider preventative factors. 

Once you have a street-level analysis, you can create a "macro-level" view of NYC to map accident hot spots by type of accident, date and time. 

You may also consider adding data of individuals that have been hit by vehicles to further enhance your analysis.
