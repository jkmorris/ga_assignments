Data Mining Algorithms Readthru - By Jay Morrison

1)	Decision Trees

2)	Classification

3)	A decision tree allows you to create a structured approach to grouping instances (such as Root Nodes, Interior Nodes and Leaf Nodes) and enables a probability to be calculated to determine the probability of membership within the given class. 

4)	Potential applications of this algorithms include:
	a.	Estimating the probability of customer defections 
	b.	Estimating the likelihood of debt write-offs given various characteristics (e.g. income, debt size, location, etc) 
	c.	Determining the probability of marriage rates given various behavior indicators
